# JavaScript Medium Problems #

This is a collection of a bunch of medium JavaScript problems that I’ve
completed over the period of several months. The problems are of somewhat
moderate difficulty, enough to actually slightly entertain my brain, but not
much more than that, hence the name “JavaScript Medium Problems.” Feel free to
browse and email me at <mailto:john@johnisom.dev> if you have any questions.
